# HF sfw

Used to make HF more "safe for work" by adding options to filter "hack forums" from titles and hide logo, profile pics, signature pics and post pics. Very useful if you do not want the extra attention in a public space or around unknowing friends and family.

## Usage

Change settings by scrolling to the bottom of any page on hackforums. There will be checkboxes to the right corresponding to different settings. Toggling any of them will change and save the settings for the next time you reload any hackforums page.

## Installation

_(Requires a userscript manager, see [main page](https://github.com/josefandersson/userscripts#installation) for more information.)_

Install the script [_here_](https://github.com/josefandersson/userscripts/raw/master/HF-sfw/hf-sfw.user.js).
