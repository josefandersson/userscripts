# YouTube Slightly Better

A bitter attempt at making the YouTube experience better. This script adds a few extra features that I've seen no other "YouTube enhancement" scripts add. Each feature can be toggled in the settings.

## Features

| Feature | Description | Key bindings | Enabled by default |
| --- | --- | :---: | :---: |
| Playback Rate | Superior method of changing video playback rate, and with better precision. | a, s, d | yes |
| Screenshot | Take screenshot and download it. | h | yes |
| Go To Timestamp | Prompts the user for a timestamp to jump to. | g | yes |
| Open Thumbnail | Open video thumbnail in new tab. | b | yes |
| Progress | Show video progression below the video (percentage, time passed or time left). | p | yes |
| Trim | Set trims for when video is autoplayed (eg. good for music videos in playlists). Video parts not within trims will be skipped. | y | yes |
| Copy | Copy video url with current timestamp. | v | yes |
| Notes | Add notes at timestamps in videos. | n | yes |
| History | Remember all watched videos and print how many times current video has been watched. | | no |
| Media Session | Fix media keys integration. | | no |
| Metadata | Save video metadata: title, uploader, etc. | - | no |
