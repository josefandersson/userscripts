# HF Title Alerts

Currently alerts (eg. been quoted, PM received, thread updates, etc.) will only update the alerts icon in the HF menu bar. If you are on another tab you will not see this alert popping up unless you have enabled web notifications.

This userscript changes the page title (tab name) when an alert is received. For example, `Hack Forums Main Page` would change to `(1) Hack Forums Main Page` when there's one new alert.

## Installation

_(Requires a userscript manager, see [main page](https://github.com/josefandersson/userscripts#installation) for more information.)_

Install the script [_here_](https://github.com/josefandersson/userscripts/raw/master/HF-title-alerts/hf-title-alerts.user.js).
